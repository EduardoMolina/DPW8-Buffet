Wall Model LES computations were performed using Volcano ScaLES solver (v2025.09) for the grid levels (1 and 2) 

## 01_scaLESv202509
Preliminary data available for grid L1 (AoA 1.22deg and AoA=2.29deg) with a short time signal ~30CTUs, for grid 2 (AoA=4.84deg and AoA=5.89deg) the simulations were run for ~100 CTUs without transient.
